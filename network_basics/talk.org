Hello, class!

Can anybody tell me what do you expect from this course?

Right, in a dream world, anything you expect from the class, you will get it.
Anything you heard in the class, you understand, you remember, and you never forget.

But in the real world, the learning thing doesn't work like this. The real world is a
nightmare that's full of suffering.
In the class, the teacher tries his best to make you feel sleepy. After class, all you can
remember is merely some keywords. And actually you don't need to remember those keywords
since they are already in the lecture slides.

So, what a class for? Well, for me it's money. I get paid for it. But, for you, charity?
You figure it out yourself.

Since you're here to learn something, let's make it clear about what's learning.

Learning is not about to get an answer to a question. It's the process to get the
answer. And the process must be hard, otherwise we don't call it learning.

Learning is very much like running around a track. What's the purpose of running round and
round? It's not the destination, but the struggle. From this struggle you get the ability
of running fast and long.

Same as running, learning is not about knowledge, it's about ability. Without struggle,
you won't get the ability of learning fast and more.

So, what a class for?
1. repeat some keywords (tell you what you should learn)
2. help you survive your struggle (answer your questions as much as I can)

You should do all the learning things after class. And make sure you always come to class
with questions.
