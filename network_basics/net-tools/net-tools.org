** Basic Examples
You have to be *root* (=sudo=) to execute iptables functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Add a rule into the INPUT chain, to drop all packets from 147.8.212.123, do
iptables -A INPUT -s 147.8.212.123 -p all -j DROP

### To delete this rule, do
iptables -D INPUT -s 147.8.212.123 -p all -j DROP

### Drop ICMP packets from localhost, do
iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.1 -p icmp -j DROP

### Drop ping packets from anywhere except localhost, do
iptables -A INPUT -s ! 127.0.0.1 -p all -j DROP

### Filter a network segment, do
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p all -j DROP

* netcat --- TCP/IP swiss army knife
- From [[http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/11/06/netcat-a-couple-of-useful-examples/]]
** Setup a simple C/S chat session
Suppose the server IP is =202.203.132.244=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### At the server side, do
nc -l 3333

### At the client side, do
nc 202.203.132.244 3333
# Start chatting
#+END_SRC

** Transferring Files
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### 1. Similar to the chat example above, at the server side, do
cat backup.iso | nc -l 3333

### 2. At the client side, do
nc 202.203.132.242 3333 > backup.iso

### As you may have noticed, netcat does not show any info about the progress of the
#   data transfer. This is inconvenient when dealing with large files. In such cases, a
#   pipe-monitoring utility like =pv= can be used to show a progress indicator. For
#   example, the following shows the total amount of data that has been transfered in
#   real-time on the server side:
cat backup.iso | pv -b | nc -l 3333

### Of course, the same can be implemented on the client side by piping netcat's output through =pv=:
nc 202.203.132.242 3333 | pv -b > backup.iso
#+END_SRC

** Other Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### 1. Netcat is extremely useful for creating a partition image and sending it to a remote machine on-the-fly:
dd if=/dev/hdb5 | gzip -9 | nc -l 3333

# On the remote machine, connect to the server and receive the partition image with the following command:
nc 202.203.132.242 3333 | pv -b > myhdb5partition.img.gz
# This might not be as classy as the partition backups using =partimage=, but it is efficient.

### 2. Another useful thing is to compress the critical files on the server machine with =tar=
#      and have them pulled by a remote machine:
tar -czf - /etc/ | nc -l 3333
# As you can see, there is a dash in the tar options instead of a filename. This is because
# tar's output needs to be passed to netcat.

# On the remote machine, the backup is pulled in the same way as before:
nc 202.203.132.242 3333 | pv -b > mybackup.tar.gz

### 3. IPv6
# In terminal A:
nc -6 -l 3333

# In terminal B:
nc -6 ::1 3333
#+END_SRC

** Telnet-like Usage
Netcat can be used in order to talk to servers like telnet does. For example, in order
to get the definition of the word “server” from the “WordNet” database at the dict.org
dictionary server, I’d do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nc dict.org 2628
DEFINE wn server
#+END_SRC

** Works as a Port Scanner too
A useful command line flag is =-z=. When it is used, netcat does not initiate a
connection to the server, but just informs about the open port it has found. Also,
instead of a single port, it can accept a port-range to scan. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nc -z cs3.swfu.edu.cn 80-90
#+END_SRC

In this example, netcat scanned the 80-90 range of ports.
** Grab Port Banners
So we're interested in knowing what's running behind port 80 and 21. We can use netcat to grab
port banners in the following way:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nc -v -n 202.203.132.242 80
nc -v -n 202.203.132.242 21
#+END_SRC

  - The man page contains some more interesting examples, so take the time to read it.

** Simple Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nmap 202.203.132.244

### no reverse DNS lookup:
nmap -n 202.203.132.244

### verbose:
nmap -n -v 202.203.132.244

### even more:
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC

** Scanning more than one machine

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.242,244
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.241-244
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.241-242,244
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.*
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.192-255
nmap -n -vv 202.203.132.192/26

nmap -vv -n 192.168.0-2.*
nmap -vv -n 192.168.0,1,2.0-255
#+END_SRC

** Scanning specific ports:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nmap -vv -n -p 80 202.203.132.244
nmap -vv -n -p 21,23,25,80-120 202.203.132.244
nmap -vv -n -p 21,23,25,80-120 202.203.132.241-244
#+END_SRC

** Various Scanning options:
There are many scanning options available with Nmap. All have their advantages and
disadvantages. You should use them according to your requirements.

*** =-sS=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### SYN scanning (this is the default option)
nmap -vv -n -sS 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC

TCP SYN scan gather information about open ports without completing the TCP handshake
process. When an open port is identified, the TCP handshake is reset before it can be
completed. This technique is often referred to as “half open” scanning.

It's the default scanning technique if you are *root*. It's the most common scan to
use because it works on all networks, across all operating systems.

- ADV :: The TCP SYN scan never actually creates a TCP session so isn't logged by the
         destination host's applications. And hence it's a quiet scan.
- DISADV :: You need privileged access to the system.

*** =-sT=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### TCP connect scanning
nmap -vv -n -sT 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
It performs the 3-way handshake.
- ADV :: You don't need to have privileged access.
- DISADV :: Since it completes a TCP connection so apparent when application
            connection logs are examined.

*I would suggest you to never ever use this scan*.

*** =-sF=, =-sX=, =-sN=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### FIN scan
nmap –vv –n –sF 218.194.106.91

### Xmas tree scan
nmap –vv –n –sX 192.168.0.1

### NULL scan
nmap –vv –n –sN 192.168.0.1
#+END_SRC

These are called “stealth” scans. They send a single frame to a TCP port without any TCP
handshaking or additional packet transfers. They are more “stealth” than SYN scan and must be
used if the remote machine is not a Windows-based machine. I’ll tell you why.

These scans operate by manipulating the bits of the TCP header. Nmap creates TCP headers that
combine bit options that should never occur in the real world. These purposely mangled TCP
header packets are thrown at a remote device, and nmap watches for the responses.

Window-based systems will reply with a RST frame for all queries, regardless of the status of
the specific port that was queried.

- ADV :: Since no TCP sessions are established, they are quiet stealthy.
- DISADV :: Can't be used against windows-based machine.

*** =-sU=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### UDP scan
nmap -vv -n -sU 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
The only scan in the arsenal of Nmap to identify UDP ports.
*** =-sO=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Protocol scan
nmap -vv -n -sO 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
Sometimes it has to be checked that what protocols the remote machine is running. It locates
uncommon IP protocols that may be in use on the remote system. Hence it helps determining the
type of remote device, i.e. is that router or printer or workstation etc.

- DISADV :: This scan will appear on any network monitoring application that identifies the IP
            protocol types in use.

*** =-sR=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### RPC scan
nmap -vv -sR 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
It's used to locate and identify RPC applications. It runs automatically during a version scan
(-sV, explained later)

- DISADV :: RPC scan opens application sessions and hence it will be logged.

*** =-sV=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Version scan
nmap –vv –sV 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
The scans which we have seen by now give you the status of the port and the service running on
them. For exploiting the service you need the exact version number of the service. Version scan
gives you this.

- DISADV :: It opens sessions with the remote applications, which will often display in an
            application's log file. 

*** =-sA=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### ACK scan
nmap –vv –sA 218.194.106.91
#+END_SRC
It's quite useful when there is some packet filtering device or firewall. It never locates an
open port. It does the job of identifying ports that are filtered through a firewall. It doesn't
open any application sessions and hence the conversation between nmap and the remote device is
relatively simple.
- DISADV :: It can only tell whether port is filtered or unfiltered.  But can never definitively
            identify an open port.

*** =-sI=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Idle scan
nmap –vv –sI 218.194.106.91
#+END_SRC
It's the stealthy most scan you can have. Tough to launch because you need a zombie for it. It
would not be justice with this great scan to be described in just few lines. I would recommend
you to read it in detail.
- ADV :: You will never be caught.
- DISADV :: Tough to launch as it's not easy to find some zombie machine.

*** =-sP=: Ping scan

You must have heard of /ping sweep/. It's Nmap's ping sweep.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# To check whether this machine is up or not, do
nmap –vv –sP 192.168.0.10

# To check the whole subnet (254) machines and will tell you which are up.
nmap –vv –sP 192.168.0.*
#+END_SRC
- DISADV :: Ping scan will not interoperate with any other type of scan.

*** =-sW=: Window scan

Forget it. As the number of operating systems vulnerable to its methodology is dwindling as
operating systems are upgraded and patched.

*** =-sL=: List scan

Would like to say only one line about it that you must use it if a separate application provides
nmap with a list of IP addresses. Rest read yourself.

** O/S fingerprinting and version detection

Ok, now you can use various scanning techniques to look for open/closed or filtered/unfiltered
TCP as well as UDP ports. Don't you want to know the remote operating system running?

*** =-O=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Operating system fingerprinting
nmap -vv -O 202.203.132.241,244
#+END_SRC

It will tell you or at least tries its best to tell you the remote operating system along with
the version it's using. It at least need one open and one close TCP port. In case it doesn't, it
won't be able to give the accurate result. In that case you should use some third party tool.

- DISADV :: A trained eye will quickly identify that someone is watching the network.

*** =-sV=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
### Version detection
nmap -vv -sV 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC
As has been explained it will help you know the version of the service running on the remote
machine.

*** =-A=: Additional, Advanced, Aggressive option

Its comprises of both the operating system fingerprinting process (=-O=) and the version scanning
process (=-sV=). i.e following two are same:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nmap -vv -sV -O 202.203.132.244
nmap -vv -A 202.203.132.244
#+END_SRC

** Typical scenario
1. First, we’ll sweep the network with a simple Ping scan to determine which hosts are online.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   nmap -sP 202.203.132.192/26
   #+END_SRC
   Tell me how many hosts are up?
2. Now we’re going to take a look at 202.203.132.240-242,244. These IPs belong to School of CIS.
   We’ll scan 202.203.132.240-242,244 using a SYN scan [-sS] and -A to enable OS fingerprinting
   and version detection.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
