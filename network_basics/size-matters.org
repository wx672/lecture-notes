* Size matters
** Ethernet frame
   - Min: (+ 6 6 2 46 4) = 64
   - Max: (+ 6 6 2 1500 4) = 1518
   - MTU: 1500
** IP packet
   - Min: 20
   - Max: 64k
   - PMTU: > 576
** TCP segment
   - Window size: 64k
   - Often: 1460
   - Min: 20
   - MSS: 536 (default)
** UDP datagram
* Checksum
  - \cite[Sec.~5.6, p.~464]{ast-net} The argument against checksums was that any application that really cares about data
    integrity has to have a transport layer checksum anyway, so having another one in IP (in
    addition to the data link layer checksum) is overkill. Furthermore, experience showed
    that computing the IP checksum was a major expense in IPv4. The antichecksum camp won
    this one, and IPv6 does not have a checksum.
