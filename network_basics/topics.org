  - supplement to wired LANs
  - BSSID - the MAC address of the AP 
  - Speed: usually 10-100 Mbps, up to 300 Mbps
  - Distance (AP to computer) 30-100m
  - ESS, a set of connected APs
    - ESSID - 32B (max) string
  - WLAN Channels
  - WLAN hotspot
  - CSMA/CA
    - RTS/CTS partially solve the hidden node problem
  - Modulation is defined as the process of manipulating a carrier signal so
    that it can represent intelligent information.
    - FHSS: Frequency shift keying (FSK)
    - DSSS: Differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK)
    - OFDM: 
  - Coding: mainly for error correction
