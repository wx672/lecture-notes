1. In terminal =A=, create socket in bash
   : exec 3<> /dev/udp/localhost/3333
2. See it's working
   In terminal =A=:
   : lsof -p `pidof bash`
   Or,
   : netstat -up
   As you can see, it's an IPv6 socket by default
3. In terminal =B=, start a listening process on port 3333
   : nc -6ul 3333
   by default =nc= uses IPv4 to setup this socket, so you have to specify the =-6= option
   explicitly.
4. Capturing packets
   In terminal =C=,
   : sudo tcpdump -vv -i lo -X port 3333
5. Sending data
   In terminal =A=,
   : echo hello >&3
   the word =hello= should now appear in both terminal =B= and =C=.
6. Try sending data from another =nc= process to port 3333
   : for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo $i | nc -6u -q1 localhost 3333; done
   the packets can be captured by tcpdump in terminal =C=, but cannot be shown in terminal
   =B=. This means the listening =nc= process only accepts data from the first sender
   process. All the packets from the following senders will be ignored silently.

Try the TCP cases yourself.
