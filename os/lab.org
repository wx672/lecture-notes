* Caution
  1. To complete the lab work, you have to be happy with 2 foreign languages, =English= and =C=.
  2. Time is short. In the lab, you have no time for both understanding the instruction
     manuals and doing the programing work. So you have to read and understand the lab
     instructions *before* you come to the lab.
  3. Your work (report + source code) must be handed in *within a week after the lab work*.
  4. To start your work, make a directory first, e.g. 20121156001. And then you should do
     everything within this directory. Finally, after you've done, make this directory a
     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_chapter/Formats.html#SEC131][=tar-ball=]] and submit it to [[mailto:wx672ster%2Bos@gmail.com][{{{email}}}]]. Besides this tar ball, in your email message
     you *must* tell me:
     1) How many hours you spent in this work?
     2) Your major work in this report;
     3) The major problems you met, and how did you solve (or try solving) them;
     4) Reference books and web links;
  5. These are Linux projects. Your work *must* be done in Linux.
     - You are *required* to finish your report with [[http://orgmode.org/][=Emacs org-mode=]]
       - To enforce the above requirement, you have to submit both an =org file= and a generated
         =html file= as your lab report.
       - A sample [[file:sample-report][report template]] written with Emacs org-mode is provided for your
         reference.
       - You can get some Chinese help about emacs at [[http://emacser.com/][Emacs中文网]].

       - If you need to draw a picture (e.g. flow chart, etc.), you can use [[http://live.gnome.org/Dia][Dia]], [[http://www.xfig.org/][xfig]], or preferably
         embed an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art][ascii art]] in your org file.
       - If you need to insert source codes into your org file, you should check:
     - http://orgmode.org/manual/Include-files.html#Include-files, and you can find some
           examples in [[#code-insertion][this section]].
     - MS-word file will *NOT* be accepted!
  6. Late reports will be penalized 20% per day.
  7. Cheating will result in automatic failure of this course.

   - *Quick start*
     1) Find out the right kernel headers package matching your running kernel:
        : uname -a
        : aptitude search ^linux-headers
        install the right headers-package matching your running kernel:
        : sudo aptitude install linux-headers-`uname -r`
     2) Make a directory to store your =Hello, world!= kernel module
        : mkdir hello-lkm && cd hello-lkm
     3) In =hello-lkm= directory, write a [[file:src/hello-lkm/hello-1.c][hello-1.c]]. (See [[http://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html#AEN119][The Linux Kernel Module
        Programming Guide]] chapter 2 for details.)  (last visited: [2020-11-20 Fri])
     4) Write a [[file:src/hello-lkm/Makefile][Makefile]]
     5) make
        : make
        If everything is ok, there should be a =hello-1.ko= file in your =hello-lkm= directory.
     6) Install the module into the running kernel
        : sudo insmod hello-1.ko
     7) See if it's running
        : lsmod | grep hello
        Does it show up? Well, and you can see "Hello, world!" here:
        : dmesg | tail
     8) Now, you can remove this useless module from the kernel by doing:
        : sudo rmmod hello_1
     9) See if it's removed:
        : lsmod | grep hello
        And you should see "Goodbye, world!" here:
        : dmesg | tail

     3. more on =fork()= and =wait()= 

        Compile and run [[./src/proc/fork-blp.c][this program]]. Tell me why the output is weird (mixed with
        the =$= prompt)? And fix it with the =wait()= system call.
     4. zombies and =waitpid()=
        - Read the *NOTES* section in the =wait= manual page (=man 2 wait=) to get a clear
          idea about zombie processes. And tell me why zombie is not welcomed.
        - At the end of =wait= manual page (=man 2 wait=), there is an example
          program. Play with it, and tell me about =WUNTRACED=, =WCONTINUED=, =WIFEXITED=,
          =WEXITSTATUS=, =WIFSIGNALED=, =WTERMSIG=, =WIFSTOPPED=, =WSTOPSIG=,
          =WIFCONTINUED=, =pause()=.
        - Compile and run [[./src/proc/zombie.c][this small program]]. This program can leave a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process][zombie process]]
          in the system. You can see it with
          : ps u
      - *Your task:*
        - Write a similar program that leaves 5 zombies.
        - Tell me what's the difference between a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process][zombie process]] and a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_process][orphan process]]?
        - Read [[https://cs6.swfu.edu.cn/calibre/get/PDF/39/calibre][Beginning Linux Programming]] (last visited: [2020-11-20 Fri]), Chapter 11, page 503 to learn how to avoid
              zombies with =waitpid()= system call. And correct the above program.
        - Tell me the difference between =exit()= and =return=.
   - *Sum up:*  In your email message, please answer the following questions.
     1. How many hours you spent in this section?

     - =man 3 pthread_attr_init=
   - *Tasks*
     1. At the end of =pthread_create= manual page (=man 3 pthread_create=), there is an example
        program. Play with it, and then tell me:
        1. What's the =tinfo[]=?
        2. What's the =res=?

* Memory management
  - *Reference*
    [[https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=173438][User-Level Memory Management in Linux Programming]], 2004. (last visited: [2020-11-20 Fri])
** Basic commands
   1. top
      : top
      With the help of =man top=, get a clear idea about:
      - VIRT :: Virtual Image (kb)

        The total amount of virtual memory used by the task. It includes all
        code, data and shared libraries plus pages that have been swapped out.

        VIRT = SWAP + RES

      - SWAP :: Swapped size (kb)

        The swapped out portion of a task's total virtual memory image.

      - RES :: Resident size (kb). (=ps -aly=).

           The non-swapped physical memory a task has used.

           RES = CODE + DATA

      - CODE :: Code size (kb)

        The amount of physical memory devoted to executable code, also
        known as the 'text resident set' size or TRS.

      - DATA :: Data+Stack size (kb)

        The amount of physical memory devoted to other than executable
        code, also known as the 'data resident set' size or DRS.

      - SHR :: Shared Mem size (kb)

           The amount of shared memory used by a task. It simply reflects
           memory that could be potentially shared with other processes.

      - nFLT :: Page Fault count

        The number of major page faults that have occurred for a task.  A page fault occurs
        when a process attempts to read from or write to a virtual page that is not
        currently present in its address space.  A major page fault is when backing storage
        access (such as a disk) is involved in making that page available.

      - nDRT :: Dirty Pages count

        The number of pages that have been modified since they were last written to disk.
        Dirty pages must be written to disk before the corresponding physical memory
        location can be used for some other virtual page.

   2. =size=, =objdump=, =nm=

      Compile [[./src/mem/size.c][this c program]] with
      : gcc -Wall size.c
      Then, use =size= to see the size of its /text/, /data/, and /bss/ segments.
      : size a.out
      The output should be something like
      : text   data   bss        dec         hex    filename
      : 1200   520    1024032    1025752     fa6d8      a.out
      If you exam its size with =ls -l=, you should get something similar to the following
      line
      : -rwxr-xr-x   1 wx672          wx672        6627 Oct 18 18:05 a.out
      Tell me:
      1. What does the =6627= mean?
      2. What do the =1200=, =520=, =1024032=, and =1025752= mean?
** Shared Memory Segments

** File system creation
   1. Create a initialized file
      : dd if=/dev/zero of=fs.img bs=1k count=10000
      You now have a file called =fs.img= that's 10MB.
   2. Use the =losetup= command to associate a loop device with the file (making it look
      like a block device instead of just a regular file within the file system):
      : sudo losetup /dev/loop0 fs.img
   3. Creating an ext2 file system within the loop device
      : sudo mke2fs /dev/loop0 
   4. Mount the newly created file system onto =/mnt= directory
      : sudo mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 /mnt
      or
      : sudo mount -o loop fs.img /mnt
   5. Get information about your new file system   
      : dumpe2fs /dev/loop0
*** Your tasks
    1. By following the above 5 steps, you've got a new file system mounted on =/mnt=
       directory. Now you can get into =/mnt=, and create a new file in it. And then
       associate it with a loop device (=/dev/loop1=), and create another file system in
       it.
    2. Plug your USB disk into your PC's USB port, and check 
       1. what file system it is?
       2. which directory it's mounted on?
       3. Use =fsck= to get some details about your USB disk.
** Finding a file with =hexdump=
   Follow the instructions in
   [[https://cs6.swfu.edu.cn/~wx672/lecture_notes/os/ext2-analysis.html#sec-3]] (last visited: [2020-11-20 Fri])
   to learn how to find a file with =hexdump= in your newly created file system.
   And then answer this question:
   - After you do '=cat hello=' at the command line, you will see on the screen the
     content of file =hello=, in our case it is '=helloworld='.
     
     Now give me a detailed picture about what is happened in the OS from '=cat hello=' to
     '=helloworld=' is shown on the screen.
